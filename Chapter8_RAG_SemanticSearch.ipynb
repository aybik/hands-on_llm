        "- **Example**: A query like *\"What is the mass of the moon?\"* might return unrelated results about movies or cinematography.\n",
        "- This happens because dense retrieval is based on embeddings and similarity, not direct keyword matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Handling Long Texts (Chunking Challenges)\n",
        "- **Transformer models have a limited context size**, restricting the number of tokens they can process at once.\n",
        "- Long documents need to be split into smaller chunks, but how this is done affects retrieval quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Chunking Strategies:\n",
        "- **One Vector per Document:**\n",
        "  - Embedding only a representative part (e.g., title or introduction) leaves out a lot of information.\n",
        "  - Averaging embeddings from multiple chunks compresses information, reducing accuracy.\n",
        "- **Multiple Vectors per Document:**\n",
        "  - Documents are split into smaller chunks, and each chunk is embedded separately.\n",
        "  - This improves retrieval accuracy but increases storage and computational requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Best Practices for Chunking:\n",
        "- **Sentence-level chunks**: Too granular, losing context.\n",
        "- **Paragraph-level chunks**: Works well if paragraphs are concise.\n",
        "- **Overlapping chunks**: Improves context retention by including nearby text.\n",
